Senario 

Consider you have two folders "folder_1" and "folder_2" 
 *In  "folder_1" there are mp4 video files their names are (1.mp4 , 2.mp4 , 3.mp4 ...) 
 *Need to create a python script to rename video files to ("VS_001", "VS_002", "VS_003")
 *Those files should be coppy to "folder_2" after renaming 
 * Do not move files from "folder_1" orginal files must keep in "folder_1"

1.Create a Python script to execute the above scenario. You can use any preferred Python libraries. Remember to consider error handling.

2.Create another script to automate this process every hour during the day (if the number of video files in "folder_1" increases after one hour). You can modify the above script, but create a new script for this purpose.

3.Submit two separate scripts.
